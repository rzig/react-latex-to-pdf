# React latex to PDF

This project is a quick demo of how to compile latex documents to PDF from a react app. This contains a copy of [texlive.js](https://manuels.github.io/texlive.js), which is GPL licensed. There's no typescript declarations for this but I could create them if it would be useful.

## Integrating into your app
Copy all pdflatex related files (including promisejs) from this public folder to yours. Then you can use the code in `App.tsx` to create PDFs!
